# Database Labs 🗄️

A comprehensive collection of database design and SQL laboratories covering fundamental to advanced topics using T-SQL (Transact-SQL).

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains hands-on labs and exercises designed to teach database concepts, from basic SQL queries to advanced database design and optimization techniques.

## 🎯 Topics Covered

### Database Design
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Schema design best practices
- Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Primary and Foreign Keys
- Indexing strategies

### SQL Basics
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
  - CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements
  - Table creation and modification
  - Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT)

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
  - SELECT queries
  - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
  - WHERE clause and filtering
  - ORDER BY and sorting
  - DISTINCT values

- **Basic Functions**
  - Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - String functions
  - Date and time functions
  - Mathematical functions

### Advanced SQL Topics
- **Joins**
  - INNER JOIN
  - LEFT/RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN
  - CROSS JOIN
  - SELF JOIN

- **Subqueries**
  - Scalar subqueries
  - Correlated subqueries
  - EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
  - IN and NOT IN operators

- **Advanced Queries**
  - GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
  - Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE)
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Recursive CTEs
  - PIVOT and UNPIVOT

- **Database Objects**
  - Views
  - Stored Procedures
  - Functions (Scalar and Table-Valued)
  - Triggers
  - Indexes (Clustered and Non-Clustered)

- **Transactions**
  - ACID properties
  - BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
  - Transaction isolation levels
  - Locking and concurrency

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Query optimization
  - Execution plans
  - Index optimization
  - Query hints
